## Install instructions

Note: If you install it on a phone that does not have Google Play Services, we won't be able to use the location service and you will have to turn off the annoying "Google Play Services is not installed" notifications.

1. Install the `.apk` file. Depending on your phone, you may recaive warnings on installing unverified apps.

2. Open app and allow permissions.

    Accessibility setting is disabled on Android 12+ by default if app does not come from an Android Store.

    To enable it:

    - Go to app info.
    - Tap on 3 dots (top-right).
    - Choose `allow restricted settings`.
    - You will be asked for you lock code or fingerprint.

    Now you can enable accessibility.

3. Proceed as per the guide on the screen.
